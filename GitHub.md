# GitHub: Overview and Purpose

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a web-based platform for **version control**, **collaboration**, and **code management**, built on top of a tool called **Git**.

You can think of it as:
> "A social network + cloud storage + project tracker for developers and teams."

## Why Do We Use GitHub?

### 1. Version Control
- Tracks every change you make to your code.
- Lets you **revert** to earlier versions if something breaks.
- Like having **unlimited undo/redo** for your entire project.

### 2. Collaboration
- Multiple developers can work on the same project **simultaneously**.
- Changes are managed through branches, pull requests, and merges.

### 3. Cloud Backup
- Your code is safely stored on GitHub’s servers.
- Accessible from anywhere — just log in.

### 4. Project Management
- Tools for issues, bug tracking, milestones, and project boards.
- You can organize, assign tasks, and track progress.

### 5. Open Source & Portfolio
- Showcase your work to the world.
- Contribute to or create **open-source projects**.
- Many companies check your GitHub profile during hiring.

## Real-World Analogy

### Local Git
Imagine you’re writing a novel on your laptop:
- Git lets you save snapshots of your novel every day.
- You can always go back to previous versions.

### GitHub
Now you upload those snapshots to **Google Drive** and:
- Share with other writers.
- Let others suggest edits (pull requests).
- Keep track of who did what, when, and why.
